# Summarization of OBD Documents using LLMs

Our goal is to build a summarization setup that can traverse all of OBDâ€™s documents, and which can be adapted to run in
production in the future, for incoming documents. The choice of final model should arise from a process we can repeat,
with minor changes, in the future.
